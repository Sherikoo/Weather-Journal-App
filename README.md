# Weather-Journal App Project

# Author: Mohamed Omar

This weather app gets a city's name code and his/her feelings, fetch the OpenWeatherApp API with my credentials to obtain the city's current temperature and weather, then post the data to my server and update the UI with all data (Date of today, Selected city's temperature and weather, and user's entered feelings).
If an invalid city name is entered, the app alerts the user.
